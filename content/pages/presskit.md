**Felonius Smith Trio** performs prewar blues music at its most authentic - taking us back to a time when original bluesmen were pioneering a new musical style.

Drawing his inspiration from the songs and styles of artists like Tampa Red and Fred McDowell, ***Felonius Smith’s*** National slide and snappy finger picking guitar style transports one back some 80 years, relaxing on a river bank in southern Mississippi.

The talented and expressive ***Steve Sheldon*** plays harmonica with the group. His love of the old country blues and his experience with American roots musical styles are reflected in his melodic sense and traditional sound.

Rounding out the trio is ***Scott Johnson***, whose warm yet percussive approach to his upright bass provides the backbone of the group’s historic Americana blues sound. When he doubles on sousaphone, it invokes the vibe of a jug band or New Orleans street band.

**Felonius Smith** has delighted audiences at festivals and nightspots on the Front Range for 10 years, sharing the stage with Richie Havens, Koko Taylor and David Bromberg.
