  Finally, a new Felonius Smith Trio album which captures the magic of our live
  performances! This is our first CD recorded Live-In-Concert, and our first to
  feature the incredible harmonica talents of Steve Sheldon, who joined the
  group in 2015. 


  “Bucking The Blues” was recorded at the Douglas H. Buck Community Recreation Center in Littleton, Colorado on February 23, 2018. It was an evening which found the band in top form and the audience in high spirits. The album boasts 16 of our most requested songs, and captures a 75 minute concert on one disc! 


  Among the songs featured on “Bucking The Blues”, you'll enjoy the soulful vocals and nifty slide guitar work of Felonius Smith on the opening track, “Prodigal Son”; the dueling melodies of slide guitar and harmonica in a unique arrangement of “St. Louis Blues”. Four songs are propelled by the big toot of J. Scott Johnson's sousaphone, including “Down By The Riverside”, “Jealous Hearted Woman”, “Your Feet's Too Big” - and “Jelly Roll Baker” with the sousaphone laying down a mean rhumba beat! On “Spoonful”, the extended, improvised interplay between harmonica and baritone slide guitar is remarkable, as is the ominous growl of the upright bass played with a bow. Another treat is the vocal duet and funky tone of the 1930's National resonator mandolin on the jug band classic “Viola Lee Blues”; and finally a rip-roaring arrangement of the Blind Willie McTell standard “Statesboro Blues”. 


  We chose to reduce our environmental footprint on this project with a simple CD sleeve packaging. Click HERE to view complete liner notes for all the details about the songs, instruments, plus art and production credits.
